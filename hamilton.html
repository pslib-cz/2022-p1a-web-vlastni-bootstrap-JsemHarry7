          <p class="d-block text-left">Lewis Hamilton is widely regarded as one of the greatest Formula One drivers of all time, if not the greatest. He holds numerous records in the sport and has won seven World Drivers' Championships, tying him with Michael Schumacher for the most championships won by a driver.<br>

            There are many reasons why Hamilton is considered the greatest of all time (GOAT). Firstly, his sheer dominance on the track is undeniable. He has won a staggering 103 Grand Prix races and has finished on the podium over 200 times. He has also taken pole position over 100 times, showcasing his incredible speed and skill in qualifying.<br>
            
            But it's not just his statistics that make him the GOAT. Hamilton is also known for his incredible racecraft and ability to overtake his opponents in difficult situations. He has pulled off some of the most memorable passes in F1 history and is known for his fearless driving style.<br>
            
            Off the track, Hamilton is also a trailblazer. He has been a vocal advocate for social justice issues and has used his platform to raise awareness for causes such as Black Lives Matter and environmentalism. He is the first black driver to compete in F1 and has broken down barriers and inspired a new generation of racers.<br>
            
            In short, Lewis Hamilton's dominance on the track, incredible racecraft, and off-track activism and advocacy make him a true GOAT of F1.</p>
